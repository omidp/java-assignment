# Java Coding Challenge

### Exercise: Word Count Kata
Please find the requirements for the Word Count Kata on the following [website](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/#cd8). At the bottom of that page you will find all requirements split into 9 iterations. The goal of this exercise is not to finish as many iterations as possible. Evaluating your solution is based on quality over quantity.

Please focus on code quality by applying

Object-Oriented Design

Please always look only at one iteration at a time. The goal is to come up with a design which makes future changes to your code base as easy as possible. 

### Feature Branches
As soon as you finish your task you will open up a pull request on GitHub. Therefore, think of solving an iteration as if you would solve a task for the team. Always focus on quality and come up with a codebase which you would be happy working in. 

For each iteration, please create a branch with the following pattern: firstname_lastname_iteration_nr_name. Your first iteration must branch off master. Every new branch must branch of the previous branch. At the end of every branch.

### Assumptions
In case the requirements are ambiguous, please write down your assumptions into the project's assumptions.txt file. Please always create a section for each iteration and put your assumptions under this section. The reason for this is, so that we can follow certain design decisions in your code which you came up with based on your assumptions.

### Evaluation
 Please make sure that your code is compiling, your tests aren't failing, the requirements are met, and the code is in a state that you are happy with. You can see these rules as the definition of done for an iteration.

This example might also seem a bit hypothetical, but we believe it small but complicated enough, that it makes sense to come up with an Object-Oriented Design which is more than implementing your whole solution in a single main method ðŸ˜‰. 

### Requirements
Please use Java 8 as a programming language. No Framework is needed for this exercise. 

### Let's Get Started
1. Please clone the repository.
2. Create a branch off master 
3. Push this branch to the repository.
4. Run mvn clean install via your terminal.
5. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
6. Read the requirements from the Requirements section. Please only read one iteration at a time starting with iteration 1.
7. Please think about how you will approach this problem in code for a few minutes without coding.
